# Scan-bot
The goal of this bot is to create something that scans exchanges for opportunities to implement arbitrage bot with acceptable stop/take parameters. 

Day 1: First day on the journey, successfully pulled data neatly from binance, but kucoin is ugly. Texting has errors. Goal for next steps - pull more data and play around withg it. 
set up a text sent on a dependency like Eth down by a percent. Send a text first. With some pretty data, start data collection process. need top pull relevant data and dump rest. 
Really only going for Eth/BTC right now. Here's to day 2! 

Day two: 
Added some coincap data. All well and good but python keeps giving me long path errors and since this frankenstein computer is already a lil touch, think im going to try
a virtual machine. That would mean I need to learn a bit more about linux but it has got to be easier than constantly trying to work with this harddrive and its problems
Could buy a fresh SSD and get a nice install of windowns buttttt i am poor so this is what we got. Could move to the laptop I guess.... Anywho day two was not as successful. Twilio api up and running tho haven't gotten a text. Closing in I can feel it. Really want to send a text next time as well as add some conditional logic so scans happen once a minute. Then texts me if a certain percentile drop is met.
