# Scan-bot
The goal of this bot is to create something that scans exchanges for opportunities to implement arbitrage bot with acceptable stop/take parameters. 

Day 1: First day on the journey, successfully pulled data neatly from binance, but kucoin is ugly. Texting has errors. Goal for next steps - pull more data and play around withg it. 
set up a text sent on a dependency like Eth down by a percent. Send a text first. With some pretty data, start data collection process. need top pull relevant data and dump rest. 
Really only going for Eth/BTC right now. Here's to day 2!
